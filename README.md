Introduction
Data mining involves extracting patterns, knowledge, and insights from large datasets. This repository focuses on a variety of data mining algorithms that cover areas such as classification and clustering. Each algorithm is accompanied by documentation, explanations, and code implementations to aid in the learning process.

Algorithms
The repository includes implementations and explanations for the following data mining algorithms:

Decision Trees
K-Means Clustering
DBSCAN(Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
...and more! The list is continuously expanding, and contributions are welcome.

Implementation
Algorithms are implemented in a  Python programming languages and uses sklearn library. Each algorithm has a dedicated file containing the source code and explanation inside as markdown.

Usage
To use the algorithms in this repository, follow the instructions provided in each algorithm's README file. Dependencies and requirements are also outlined to ensure a smooth setup process.

Contributing
Contributions are highly encouraged! If you have implemented a new algorithm, improved an existing one, or found a bug, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines.
